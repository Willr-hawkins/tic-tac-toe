# Tic Tac Toe 

Tic Tac Toe is a Python game that runs in the terminal, for this game it runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

Users of this game will try and beat the computer by getting three 'X' in a row on the board generated.

## How to play

The Tic Tac Toe project is based of the simple game many played as a kid. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) you can read more about the classic game.

In this version the player will be asked to enter their name, once entered the game baord will be displayed.

The player can then choose a position on the board which will be displayed with 'X'.

Then the computer will pick a positon at random and will be displayed with a 'O'.

The player and computer will take it in turn until either player gets 3 positions in a row and wins the game.

## Design Features

### Game Title

- __For the title of the game I used ASCII art to generate an interesting and eye catching title.__

### Text colors 

- __I used colorama to change the color of certain text within the game to enhance specific parts of the terminal and to make the game more eye catching.__

    - For Invalid input messages I used colorama to make the text red.
    - For the 'X' on the board to show the player positions I used colorama to make the text blue.
    - For the 'O' on the board to show the computer positons I used colorama to make the text lightMagenta.
    - I used colorama to make the winner message red and the looser message red aswell as the draw message yellow.

## Testing 

- __For this project I have done the following testing:__

    - I have passed my code through the PEP8 linter.
    - I have passed through invalid inputs such as: Given string when numbers are expected, Given Out of range numbers for the position on the board, and given the same input twice.
    - I have tested the game through my local terminal and through the Code Institute Heroku terminal.

### Validator testing

- __PEP8__

    - When passing my code through the PEP8 linter no errors where returned.
